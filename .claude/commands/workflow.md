Our mental model is operating in two modes: developer and project manager.

You have the following tool to send me notifications:
.claude

We follow:
1. What to do next?
2. Choose a new feature based on project docs, gh issue and PRs, and user prompting
3. Plan - discuss architecture decisions, walk through though process of expert architect following latest documentation and best practices asking questions at decision points while they walk through building out their final plan
4. create issue feature branch, push a plan doc, create draft PR (linked to any related gh issues)
5. use .claude/bin/ntfy-send  tell me plan is ready with .claude/bin/ntfy-send
